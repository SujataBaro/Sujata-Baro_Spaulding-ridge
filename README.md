 Employee Compensation Forecasting Application — Case Study Assignment
💼 Employee Compensation Forecasting App – Case Study by Sujata Baro
Welcome! This project is a case study I created as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a mid-sized company. The goal was to build a practical, data-driven application to help HR and finance teams make better decisions around employee compensation planning.
🚀 What This Project Does
This tool helps users:
•	Import and clean employee compensation data
•	Explore and analyze key trends across roles, departments, and locations
•	Filter and group employees by experience, role, or region
•	Simulate salary hikes and forecast their impact
•	Export the updated salary data as a CSV file
In short, it’s a lightweight yet powerful tool for workforce cost forecasting.
🧰 Tech Stack
•	Python in Jupyter Notebook
•	Pandas, NumPy for data wrangling
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
•	Sample CSV data for demo purposes
📝 What I Worked On
This case study walks through:
•	Cleaning and exploring employee data
•	Visualizing compensation distribution
•	Grouping by attributes like experience and department
•	Simulating salary increments (you get to choose the percentage!)
•	Exporting the final results for easy sharing
👩‍💻 Why I Built This
I wanted to showcase how analytics can simplify compensation planning—an often complex, spreadsheet-heavy task. With this, HR teams can quickly run "what-if" scenarios and plan with confidence.
